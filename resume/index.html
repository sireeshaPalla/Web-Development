    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>D.E. SHAW | Tech Intern</h4>
        <h5>January 2024 – June 2024 | Hyderabad, Telangana</h5>
        <p> As a Software EngineerIntern on the Quant Systems team at D.E. Shaw, I took
            ownership of developing and implementing a robust automation framework for
            our service management framework.
        </p>
            <p>
                By leveraging Python and Pytest, I constructed a scalable and maintainable
            solution that increased test coverage by 100 percent, accelerated test
            execution by 96 percent, and uncovered 50+ defects
            </p>
            <p>
                Demonstrating my ability to quickly learn and adapt, I successfully conceived,
                designed, and implemented this entire automation solution within just three
                months of joining the team.

        <p>Interned as a Software Development Intern at Amazon Kindle Royalty Costing
            team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developed a Kotlin-based tool to detect and rectify 5 types ofroyalty term
                anomalies (exceeding initial project scope by 67 percent),resulting in projected
                annual cost savings of over 1 million dollar by preventing unnecessary royalty
                payments. Utilized AWS Lambda, Git, and JUnit for efficient development and
                testing.
